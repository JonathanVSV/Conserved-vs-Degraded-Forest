# Conserved-vs-Degraded-Forest

This repository contains the data and scripts used to identify differences between the structural attributes of conserved and degraded tropical dry forest in the Ayuquila River watershed, Mexico. 

The scripts and data can be found inside the Scripts folder. The Mann-Whitney test and logistic regression procedure can be consulted in the Wilcox_LogReg.R file, while the correlations analysis can be consulted in the Correlations.R file. The script used for calculating the accuracy of each structural variable for classifying the plots into degraded and conserved is available in AccuracyClass.R file. In turn, the scripts used to construct the boxplots and barplots are available in the Boxplots.R and Barplots.R. Finally, the data used to perform all the analyses is available in the plots_data.csv file.

To download all the files click on the green button "Code" and download as zip or open with Github Desktop App.
