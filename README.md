The scripts that contain the compelte analyses can be consulted in the following files: Wilcox_LogReg.R, Correlations.R and AccuracyClass.R. In turn, the scripts used to make the plots is available in two files: Boxplots.R and correlation_plots.R. Finally, the data used to perform all the analyses is available in the plots_data.csv file.
