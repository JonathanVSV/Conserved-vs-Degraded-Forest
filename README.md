# Conserved-vs-Degraded-Forest
This repository contains the data and scripts used to analyse if the structural attributes of conserved and degraded forests in the Ayuquila River watershed, Mexico show statistically significant differences between them. The Mann-Whitney test and logistic regression procedure can be consulted in the Analysis.R file, while the correlations analysis can be consulted in the Correlations.R file. In turn, the scripts used to construct the boxplots and barplots are available in the Boxplots.R and Barplots.R. Finally, the data used to perform all the analyses is available in the plots_data.csv file.
